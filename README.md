### About me: I'm a 4th year PhD candidate at the University of Arizona studying Biomedical Engineering in Dr. Jeong-Yeol Yoon's Biosensors laboratory.  

<em>Pronouns: he/him/his</em>  

Within my repositories, you'll find some publicly-available projects I've used to complete some of my research, as well as some side-projects I've worked on (both finished and unfinished)

[You can find my lab's GitHub organization here!](https://github.com/yoon-bsl)  

Here's a list of some of my publications:
* [Emulsion-based Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification for Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Detection via Angle-dependent Light Scatter Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113099)
* [Interfacial Effect-based Quantification of Droplet Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification for Bacterial Infection](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46028-8)
* [Human Sensor-inspired Supervised Machine Learning of Smartphone-based Paper Microfluidic Analysis for Bacterial Species Classification](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113335)
